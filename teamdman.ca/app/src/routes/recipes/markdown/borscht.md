## Comments

I did it a bit different than the Reddit recipe

- Used a soup pot instead of a crock pot, because the crock pot was too small
    - Needs less cooking time on the stove; ~2.5 hours instead of 5 hours
- Added chopped mushrooms 
- Used a bag of baby carrots instead of normal carrots; shredded with a cheese grater
- Used an additional potato instead of a beet

Websites caution to use gloves and stuff because of the beet juice. It's not that bad, wash your hands and cutting board soon and it shouldn't stain. Avoid wearing your favourite shirt as shredding with a cheese grater can be messy, but it didn't stain my hands or anything.
