Given a `chat.rest` file that uses VSCode extension `humao.rest-client` to submit rest requests,
create a python function that accepts a path to a `.rest` file and uses string manipulation to split the
contents by to identify each request. then find the method at the start of each request `GET`
or `POST`. Make sure to trim whitespace. followed by the URL, followed by headers on the line after
the URL in yaml, followed an empty line, followed by a json payload for POST requests.
The output should be an array of objects. each object should have a `method`, `location`. `headers`,
and `body` fields
