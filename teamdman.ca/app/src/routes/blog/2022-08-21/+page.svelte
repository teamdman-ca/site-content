	There's something appealing about hidden information. In the Netflix true crime series

	<aside>Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel 2021 ‧ Documentary ‧ 1 season</aside>

	there's a girl who disappeared, and a bunch of internet stalkers crawled through every piece of
	social media from the victim, which included a tumblr blog. Something about that has stuck with
	me, probably from some unhealthy psychological complex? People caring about the blog posts of
	someone, elevating them to some sort of celebrity status. Maybe it's like isekai, where the main
	character is basically the ultimate self insert. True crime is interesting because it brings the
	insanity of life a little closer to our closed off worlds.

	<br />
	<br />

	There's a lot of stuff we all get exposed to in life, and I feel like I have some unique
	experiences that would be good to share. The problem is that sharing this stuff in a way that
	engages with others is challenging, some monkey part of my brain thinks of the cecil hotel series
	and the main take away is that being murdered is a potentially effective method for getting blog
	views.

	<br />
	<br />

	There's something about mysterious websites that's also facinating. ARGs and other stuff. I have a
	list of inspiration sites, which interestingly overlaps with my list of interesting sound design.
	I want to make some AI music and sound effects using encoder-decoder stuff, but I'm too lazy.

	<br />
	For now I plan on keeping the blog unlinked from the index page. Only discoverable if you care enough
	to use webpage discovery tools, or (more easily) if you just look at my github activity. It's liberating
	to start this way, no need to opt into some kind of CMS, instead just typing whatever garbage I want
	and barely formatting it. I anticipate this being read from github more than the actual website (if
	ever read at all). At least the auto formatter I have adds line breaks so even the raw code will be
	pretty readable.

	<br />
	<br />

	The ARG / unknown theme of some of these neat websites would definitely be negated if the whole
	website was open source like I plan to keep mine. I think there's still plenty of ways I can
	explore websites as an art form, leaving the choice of peeking beyond the curtain to any who
	really want to.

	<br />
	<br />
	I think it was the Cortex podcast where CGPGrey recently mentioned reading letters to yourself they
	had previously written. I don't think I have any of those, but I can look at git commits from some
	of my earliest stuff, some old screenshots I have, and it forms a kind of scrapbook but still doesn't
	have everything that the letter-to-self kinda encapsulates. Having to compress ideas to keep them digestible
	but without wasting the reader's time is quite a skill.

	<br />

		<h2>Letter to myself</h2>
		Dear me,
		<br />
		I still have yet to make a video essay, but I want to pursue youtube as a content creator more. I
		have a list of projects that I want to implement already, but for some reason I don't find the effort
		to do any of them now that I don't have school projects as an excuse? I expect future me to have
		created at least one high quality youtube video longer than 5 minutes. I created the Blind Guardian
		- Battlefield music video during summer vacation, but that doesn't quite count. If not youtube, then
		I expect progress on SuperFactoryManager at least. There's something voyeuristic about writing this
		where I know others can see. I wonder if the self-filtering that comes with knowing this is public
		devalues the theraputic effects that are associated with journaling? Currently going through Jacob
		Geller's patreon content, great stuff.
	</div>
	<br />

	I wonder if this will inspire more blog posts now that I've broken the ice, or if this is doomed
	to hiatus like the isekai story I want to write. At least I can consider this a completed item, I
	tried creating a video on text-to-image software but basically gave up. The Vox video is so good,
	I don't have any concrete thoughts to make a video. Will probably create a page on this website
	instead at some point. Much easier to play to my strengths, but I still want a video for some
	reason.

	<br />
	<br />

	I quite literally expect nobody to see this, but am still procrastinating a closing sentence? I'm
	also not confident I won't relent at some point and link to these in a more discoverable way.

	<br />
	<br />

	Haaaaaaaaave a good one, peace.
