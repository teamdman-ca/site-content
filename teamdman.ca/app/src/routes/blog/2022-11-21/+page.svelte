Currently stoned reading the MPLv2 license.
Going to be making an app for a college, they sent an intellectual property agreement as part of a "Non-teaching curreculum development offer letter" contract.
I'm not sure if I should sign it, I'm not sure if I should even be working for them.


> The Employee agrees that all Innovations made and conceived by the Employee during
the Employee's employment with the College and any Intellectual Property Rights made
or conceived by the Employee during the Employee's employment with the College shall,
upon conception, be the sole and exclusive property of the College.

I've used the MPLv2 license for a bunch of Minecraft modding, but I haven't read it recently so now I need to double check
and make sure that it does what I think and want it to be doing.

That's what GitHub Copilot suggested after the line breaks. Haha.
I'm more concerned about what I do with my free time. Once again, URF has been taken away by Riot.
No other games really hold my interest to be playing alone right now. When friends are on we have a good selection:
PlateUp, Golf with Friends, Dying Light (if all of us are on), StickFight, DuckGame are the main ones.
They play rocket league together, I haven't been about it much. Recently bought a new controller on a black friday sale,
so that might spark a willingness to try the game again. 

The CoPilot suggestions are very funny. I'm interested in $the idea of a "code assistant" but I'm not sure how I feel about it.$.
Haha. I'm more interested in the general-intelligence large language models that we have been creating. There's a lot of feelings
I have about it, and I'm not quite sure what the script should look like for a video on it.

It's hard to do anything programming related when I have this thesis to do. I have so many projects that I want to work on,
but a majority of them rely on coding, which leads to feeling like I should be working on my thesis instead. This limits my usual
methods for creative outlet. Now in my truly solo free time I usually: read any available web chapters that have came out,
work on my thesis, check discord & messenger, and play chess. One immediate problem is that my free time is having lines blurred
with work time. Right now I suppose I'm writing this blog instead of writing on my thesis, but my entire workstation is in thesis mode
right now. It's suffocating.

Well. Closed a few windows, and I suppose it's better now. Or is it? Can I placebo myself into thinking I'm better now?
Is it just because I'm high?

After typing "It's suffocating" I thought about $how suffocating is a word that I've never used before. I've never had a reason to use it.$
The CoPilot suggestion really matched my thought process. Which I thought was interesting, I think I was thinking so strongly about how that would
be a tropey response, that I'm not even sure how deep that sentence was supposed to be.

The idea of unconscious bias is gaining understanding in the public conscious.
Transphobia is the most prevalent bias I notice in others around me. I think
a lot of people are dismissive in mental illness which bleeds into transphobia.
There are a lot of mental aspects to how our identities form that we do not understand.
Transgenderism isn't a mental illness, but even if it were, why should that be a reason to dismiss it?

I am mentally checking my ideals right now.
I type "transgenderism isn't a mental illness", then I want to edit that to say "not _always a".
I can think it through, "because there exists one case where transgenderism isn't a mental illness, it would be more _accurate_ to qualify it with the word 'always'".
Then I think about the sentence:
"Transgenderism isn't always a mental illness"
which is not the vibe I want to convey.

I want to be a 100% supporter for transgenderism.
I agree, on principal, that some people feel they were born in the wrong body. or as the wrong gender?
I'm not sure on the specifics, but I get it enough to support it.
My mantra, the phrase I tell myself when I think about _who I am_, is "the circumstances of one's birth should not bear on who they could be"
There's a mewtwo quote about this, but I think the verbatim one isn't the vibe I am.

Gender norms are a huge influence on the attitudes and lives that humans develop. 
The things we are surrounded with, the language being used, messaging both
overt and covert. Our most formative years $are spent in a gendered environment.$
The problem is not only that people feel they are in the wrong body, it's that other bodies
have such a huge state space which is not reachable from most individuals to any other.
The idea of there being a "normal body" is toxic when any possible "normal" body would be 
infinitely different from your own.

I don't know what I'm doing this for. It feels like I can "dismiss" this as writing for a video idea.
It really just feels like drinking my own piss, "in this moment I am euphoric" type shit.
I think the most important thing is that this is meant to be stream of consciousness writing,
so I can write whatever I want and $not worry about it being "good" or "bad" or "useful" or "not useful".$
Literally any text is an accomplishment.

Don't school shooters write manifestos?
The copilot suggestions for the next line here were really dark.
Biases in my thought I've identified:
- creative writing has been tainted in my mind by popular discussion of school shooters. This would make me like a thirdhand-victim of this stuff.
- It feels wrong to consider myself or express myself as a victim. 
- I experience an urge to be more "accurate" in my writing when discussing transgenderism, which hurts the theme of the messaging.
