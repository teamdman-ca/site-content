# 2023 Christmas Recipe

https://joythebaker.com/2021/11/moms-peanut-butter-balls/

Yield: 80 balls, 1 TBSP each in size

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups creamy peanut butter (360g)
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 6 cups powdered sugar (start with 4 cups)
- 18 ounces dark chocolate chunks (about 1 1/2 bags chocolate chips)
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil

## Instructions

1. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine peanut butter, butter, vanilla, salt, and half of the powdered sugar. You can also do this by hand with a wooden spoon and clean hands.

2. Blend on low speed until the mixture begins to come together. Stop the mixer, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the remaining powdered sugar. Mix until thoroughly combined. The mixture will be very thick, but not dry. The powdered sugar should incorporate easily.

3. Remove the bowl from the stand and use a small cookie scoop to scoop dough and roll peanut butter balls between your hands to make a tight, round ball. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight.

4. In a heatproof bowl combine chocolate chunks and coconut oil. Place the bowl over a small pot of simmering water and let sit until chocolate begins to melt. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and reduce heat so the water is just at a low simmer.

5. Remove the balls from the refrigerator and using your fingers, dip half of each ball into the melted chocolate, and return to the parchment-lined sheet. Repeat until all balls are dipped and place in the refrigerator to chill and harden the chocolate.

6. Keep peanut butter balls covered and stored in the refrigerator, or pack them in holiday tins and stored in the refrigerator for gifting. Peanut butter balls last up to 2 weeks if not longer covered well and cool.
