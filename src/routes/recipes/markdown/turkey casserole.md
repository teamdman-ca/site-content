Makes 8 servings.

## Ingredients

- 6 cups chopped cauliflower
- 1 pound Crimini baby bella mushrooms, washed and sliced
- 4 cups cooked leftover turkey or chicken
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp. dried thyme
- 1 tsp. poultry seasoning
- salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup coarsely grated Mozzarella cheese

### Sauce Ingredients

- 1 cup sour cream (regular or light, but do not use fat free which has added sugar)
- 1/2 cup mayo
- 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1/2 tsp. dried thyme
- 1/2 tsp. dried poultry seasoning
- 1 cup grated Mozarella cheese
- 1/4 cup coarsely grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

Spray a large casserole dish with olive oil or non-stick spray. Preheat oven to 375F/190C.

Chop up enough cauliflower to make 6 cups of small cauliflower pieces. Then use a food processor with a steel blade to pulse the cauliflower until it's chopped slightly larger than kernels of rice. (You can also use a box grater to make cauliflower rice if you don't have a food processor.)

Wash the mushrooms and cut into thick half slices. Dice the leftover meat into bite-sized pieces. Mix together the sour cream, mayo, Dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp each dried thyme and poultry seasoning, 1 cup grated Mozzarella, and 1/4 cup Parmesan to make the thick sauce mixture.

Heat 2 tsp. olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan and saute the mushrooms over medium-high heat until they release their liquid, all liquid evaporates, and mushrooms are starting to brown. Put mushrooms in the bottom of the casserole dish. Add about 2tsp. more olive oil and saute the onions over medium-high heat until they are softened and starting to brown. Put Put onions over the mushrooms in the casserole dish. Heat another 2tsp of olive oil and add the finely-chopped cauliflower. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until the cauliflower is starting to soften and barelyt brown, abnout 3-4 minutes. Add the 1 teaspoon of each dryed thyme and poultry seasoning and cook about 1 minute more. Season the cauliflower rice with a little salt and fresh-ground black pepper, then put it into the casserole dish over the mushroom and onions.

Put the diced turkey into the casserole dish over the veggies and use a plastic spoon to combine the ingredients right in the dish. You can do this in a bowl if you prefer, but we were trying to get away without dirtying another dish. Spread the sauce mixture over the top and then use the spoon to gently combine the ingredients with the sauce, until the ingredients are well mixed in the sauce. Wipe off the sides of the casserole dish with a paper towl if needed. Sprinkle with Mozzarella cheese and bake uncovered until the casserole is starting to bubble and the top is nicely browned, about 40 minutes.

Let cool about 5 minutes, then cut into 8 servings and eat while hot. This kept amazingly well in the fridge for days and can be easily reheated in the microwave or in a pan on the top of the stove. I'm guessing it freezes well but I ate all my leftovers before I could freeze any.
